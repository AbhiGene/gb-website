				<h1>This is a biomanufacturing company.</h1>
					<p>And it's fucking perfect.</p>

				<h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want to work on?</h2>
					<p>You probably write javascript and think your shit is special. Maybe you think your stem cell biology project for class is going to get you some fucking award. Maybe you think your neural nets are cool because they can pick out which fucking clown is going to buy fucking $30 mugs online. Wrong motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect job:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Shit's going to save the planet</li>
						<li>Makes the sexiest, cleanest products around</li>
						<li>Deals with serious fucking hardware</li>
						<li>Needs some real ass machine learning</li>
						<li>It's fucking cool</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
					<p>You. Are. In. The. Right. Place.
					<p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect job.</p>
                <h3><b>We're hiring.</b></h3>


				<!-- <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
					<p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
				<h2>It's responsive</h2>
					<p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
				<h2>It fucking works</h2>
					<p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
					<p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
					<p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
				<h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
					<P>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</P>
				<h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
					<p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <span class="engras"> ones we create ourselves.</span> Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
